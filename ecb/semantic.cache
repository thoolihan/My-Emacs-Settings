Selecting a node in a maximized tree-window is handled very smart by ECB:

If a tree-buffer-name is not contained in this option then selecting a node in

displays all windows of the current layout) so the user can perform the next
logical step (e.g. the next logical step after selecting a directory in the
directories-buffer is to select a source-file - therefore the sources-buffer
of current layout has to be displayed - if the current layout contains one;
the next logical step of selecting a source-file is probably to jump to a
certain tag via the methods-buffer).

If a tree-buffer-name is contained in this option then selecting a node in
this tree-buffer automatically maximizes the next logical tree-window (e.g.
directories --> sources, sources/history --> methods). But if the current

select more than one node (e.g. more than one source-file from the
sources-buffer.

which contains the buffer-name as value. The latter one is recommended for the
builtin ECB-tree-buffers because then simply the related option-symbol can be
used (e.g. `ecb-directories-buffer-name', `ecb-sources-buffer-name' or
`ecb-history-buffer-name').

then it behaves like with value 'all.

'edit-and-compile:

Like 'only-edit plus the compile window if any. If the
selected window is neither an edit-window nor the compile-window then it
behaves like with value 'all.

'smart:

With this setting ECB tries to choose the `other-window'-destination or the
\"other window\" to scroll in a smart and intuitive way: If point is in one of
the edit-windows and if the edit-area is splitted then always the \"next\"
edit-window is choosen (whereas the next edit-window of the last edit-window
is the first edit-window)- if the edit-area is unsplitted then the
compile-window is used if there is one. In the context of an
`other-window'-call the ARG of `other-window' will be taken into account.

If one of the special ecb-windows is selected then always the \"next\"
ecb-window is choosen (whereas the next ecb-window of the last ecb-window is
the first ecb-window). In the context of an `other-window'-call the ARG of
`other-window' will be taken into account. If there is only one ecb-window
then ECB considers also the edit-windows!

If the compile-window is selected then always the last selected edit-window
will be used unless `other-window' has been called with a prefix-argument
unequal 1.

If there is an active minibuffer:

Regardless of the allowed values above ECB handles the situation of an active
minibuffer during a call to `other-window' or `scroll-other-window' like
follows:

If the minibuffer-window is selected then ECB always chooses the window
`minibuffer-scroll-window' points to (when this variable is set, otherwise
the compile-window or the last selected edit-window is choosen) when the
called command is called to choose the 1. next window (always true for
scrolling another window or true when `other-window' called without prefix-arg
or with prefix-arg equal 1). Otherwise the window ARG steps away is choosen
(in case of `other-window).

If there is an active minibuffer but the minibuffer-window is not selected
then `other-window' and `scroll-other-window' behave like the original
version.

In addition to the allowed values above the value of this option can also be a
function:

This function gets seven arguments:
1. A canonical list of all currently visible windows of the `ecb-frame'
2. A canonical list of all currently visible edit-windows
3. A canonical list of all currently visible ecb-windows
4. The window-object of the compile-window if there is any.
5. The minibuffer-window of the ECB-frame if there is an active minibuffer.
5. The result of the function `ecb-where-is-point' - see the documentation
   of this function for details.
6. An integer which indicates how many steps away from the current selected
   window the \"other-windowis. Is nil when this function is called in
   another context then for `other-window'.
The function has to return a window-object which is then used as \"other
window\" for the command `other-window' or for scrolling another window
(e.g. with `scroll-other-window').

This function has to handle all properly situations for itself.
`ecb-get-other-window-smart' is an example for such a function." nil [35667 39769]) ("ecb-advice-window-functions" variable nil (quote (other-window delete-window delete-other-windows delete-windows-on split-window-horizontally split-window-vertically split-window switch-to-buffer switch-to-buffer-other-window display-buffer other-window-for-scrolling balance-windows)) ((user-visible . t)) "*Advice functions to be more intelligent if used with ECB.
You can choose the following functions to be adviced by ECB so they behave as
if the edit-window(s) of ECB would be the only windows(s) of the ECB-frame:
- `other-window'
  For this one see also the option `ecb-other-window-behavior'!
- `delete-window'
- `delete-other-windows'
- `delete-windows-on'
- `split-window-horizontally'
- `split-window-vertically'
- `split-window'

  `split-window-horizontally' are autom. enabled too!
- `switch-to-buffer'
- `switch-to-buffer-other-window'
- `display-buffer'
  Especially if `ecb-compile-window-height' is not nil it is strongly
  recommended not to disable this advice!
- `other-window-for-scrolling': If this advice is enabled then the behavior of
  the following functions depends on `ecb-other-window-behavior':
  - `scroll-other-window'
  - `scroll-other-window-down'
  - `beginning-of-buffer-other-window'
  - `end-of-buffer-other-window'
- `balance-windows': Only the edit-windows of the ecb-frame are balanced.

For working most conveniently with ECB it is the best to advice all these
functions, because then all the standard shortcuts of these functions are also
usable with ECB without doing anything else. Also other packages can interact
best with ECB if these functions are all adviced. If these adviced functions
are called in another frame than the ECB-frame they behave all exactly like the
not adviced versions!

But please read also the following:

Normally all packages should work correct with ECB and it´s adviced functions
but if there occur problems with a package cause of some of these adviced
functions ECB offers the following fall-back solution:

1. Deactivate in `ecb-advice-window-functions' all the adviced-functions which
   make problems with other packages.
2. For every of the advice-able functions <adv-FUNC> ECB offers a interactively
   function named \"ecb-<adv-func>\" which does exactly the same as the
   adviced version of <adv-func>. Use \"ecb-<adv-func>\" instead the original
   one to get the proper ECB behavior even if the function is not adviced
   anymore.
3. You can bind in `ecb-activate-hook' the standard-shortcut of <adv-func> to
   \"ecb-<adv-func>\" and rebind it in `ecb-deactivate-hook' to <adv-func>.
4. Now you have the best of both worlds: The problematic package works and you
   have the ECB-behavior of <adv-func> as if it would be adviced.

Here is an example: Suppose you must deactivating the advice for
`switch-to-buffer-other-window'. Then you deactivate this function with this
option and you can use `ecb-switch-to-buffer-other-window' instead. Bind the
shortcut you normally use for `switch-to-buffer-other-window' to
`ecb-switch-to-buffer-other-window' (use `ecb-activate-hook' for this) and
rebind it to the original function in the `ecb-deactivate-hook'." nil [39771 45041]) ("ecb-advice-window-functions-signal-error" variable nil nil ((user-visible . t)) "*Signal an error if an adviced function can not do its job.

switch to another buffer in one of the ecb-tree-windows. For details see the

functions that use such functions and you don't want them to fail with an

TYPE is the

\"ecb-layout-function-<name>\". CREATE-CODE is all the lisp code which is
necessary to define the ECB-windows/buffers. This macro adds the layout with
NAME and TYPE to the internal variable `ecb-available-layouts'.

Preconditions for CREATE-CODE:
1. Current frame is splitted at least in one edit-window and the column(s)
   (for layout types left, right and left-right) rsp. row (for a top layout)
   for the special ECB-windows/buffers. Depending on the value of the option
   `ecb-compile-window-height' there is also a compile window at the bottom of
   the frame which is stored in `ecb-compile-window'.

2. All windows are not dedicated.

3. Neither the edit-window nor the compile-window (if there is one) are
   selected for types left, right and top. For type left-right the left
   column-window is selected.

4. All ECB-advices for the functions in `ecb-advice-window-functions' are
   disabled!

Things CREATE-CODE has to do:
1. Splitting the ECB-windows-column(s)/row (s.a.) in all the ECB-windows the
   layout should contain (e.g. directories, sources, methods and history).
   The split must not be done with other functions than `ecb-split-hor' and
   `ecb-split-ver'! It is recommended not to to use a \"hard\" number of
   split-lines or -columns but using fractions between -0.9 and +0.9! Tip: It
   is recommended to spilt from right to left and from bottom to top or with
   other words: First create the right-most and bottom-most special windows!

2. Making each special ECB-window a dedicated window. This can be done with
   one of the following functions:
   + `ecb-set-directories-buffer'
   + `ecb-set-sources-buffer'
   + `ecb-set-methods-buffer'
   + `ecb-set-history-buffer'
   + `ecb-set-speedbar-buffer'
   Each layout can only contain one of each tree-buffer-type!

   In addition to these functions there is a general macro:
   + `defecb-window-dedicator':
   This macro defines a so called \"window-dedicator\" which is a function
   registered at ECB and called by ECB to perform any arbitrary code in
   current window and makes the window autom. dedicated at the end. This can
   be used by third party packages like JDEE to create arbitrary ECB-windows
   besides the standard tree-windows.

   To make a special ECB-window a dedicated window either one of the five
   functions above must be used or a new \"window-dedicator\"-function has to
   be defined with `defecb-window-dedicator' and must be used within the
   layout-definition.

3. Every(!) special ECB-window must be dedicated as described in 2.

4. CREATE-CODE must work correctly regardless if there is already a
   compile-window (stored in `ecb-compile-window') or not
   (`ecb-compile-window' is nil)

Things CREATE-CODE can do or can use:
1. Using the values of `ecb-compile-window-height', `ecb-windows-width',
   `ecb-windows-height' and `ecb-compile-window-width'.

Things CREATE-CODE must NOT do:
1. Splitting the edit-window
2. Creating a compile-window
3. Deleting the edit-window, the compile-window (if there is any) or the
   ECB-windows-column(s)/row (see Precondition 1.)
4. Referring to the values of `ecb-edit-window' or `ecb-compile-window'
   because these values are always nil or undefined during CREATE-CODE.
5. Using the function `ecb-compile-window-live-p'.

Postconditions for CREATE-CODE:
1. The edit-window must be the selected window and must not be dedicated.
2. Every window besides the edit-window (and the compile-window) must be
   a dedicated window (e.g. a ECB-tree-window)." nil [208719 214974]) ("put" code nil [215145 215193]) ("ecb-layout-undefine" function nil ("name") nil "Unbind ecb-layout-function-<NAME>, ecb-delete-window-ecb-windows-<NAME>,

The value is a cons-cell where the car is a common-prefix key for all the

key-binding has the following form:

  '(<common-prefix-flag> <keysequence> <function>) where

<common-prefix-flag>: If t then the common-prefixkey defined as car of the
                      value (see above) is used.
<keysequence>: If the common prefixkey is used then the final key-binding is the
               concatenation of the common-prefixkey (see above) and this
               keysequence.
<function>: The function to bind to the key. This can also be a
            lambda-expression .

It is highly recommended to use one of the standard keys C-c or C-x as first key
of your common-prefixkey!

You MUST change this option via customize to take effect!

All keysequences must be inserted as a string and must follow the syntax needed
by `read-kbd-macro' or `kbd'. This means you can insert the key in the same
manner \"C-h k\" displays keysequences. Here is the summary of the syntax:

Text is divided into \"words \" separated by whitespace. Except for the words
described below, the characters of each word go directly as characters of the
keysequence. The whitespace that separates words is ignored. Whitespace in the
macro must be written explicitly, as in \"C-c SPC\".

  * The special words RET, SPC, TAB, DEL, LFD, ESC, and NUL represent special
   control characters. The words must be written in uppercase.

  * A word in angle brackets, e.g., <return>, <down>, <left> or <f1>, represents
    a function key. (Note that in the standard configuration, the function
    key <return> and the control key RET are synonymous.). You can use angle
    brackets on the words RET, SPC, etc., but they are not required there.

  * Keys can be written by their ASCII code, using a backslash followed by up
    to six octal digits. This is the only way to represent keys with codes
    above \377.

  * One or more prefixes M- (meta), C- (control), S- (shift), A- (alt),
    H- (hyper), and s- (super) may precede a character or key notation. For
    function keys, the prefixes may go inside or outside of the brackets:
    C-<down> = <C-down>. The prefixes may be written in any order: M-C-x =
    C-M-x.
    Prefixes are not allowed on multi-key words, e.g., C-abc, except that the
    Meta prefix is allowed on a sequence of digits and optional minus sign:
    M--123 = M-- M-1 M-2 M-3.
